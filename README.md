## CapStone Project: Enhancing a Community Library Website
**Background Scenario**

You're part of a development team tasked with enhancing the website for the "Greenwood Community Library." The website aims to be more engaging and informative for its visitors. It currently includes basic sections: Home, About Us, Events, and Contact Us. Your team decides to add a "Book Reviews" section and update the "Events" page to feature upcoming community events.

You will simulate the roles of two contributors: "Morgan" and "Jamie". Morgan will focus on adding the "Book Reviews" section, while Jamie will update the "Events" page with new community events.

**Objectives**
 - Practice cloning a repository and working with branches in Git.
 - Gain experience in staging, committing and pushing changes from both developers
 - Create pull requests and merge them after resolving any potential conflicts.

**Setup**
1. Create a Repository on GitHub:
    - Name it greenwood-library-website.
    - Initialize it with a README.md file and clone it to your local machine.

**Tasks**
1. In the main branch, using Visual Studio Code editor ensure there are files for each of the web pages.
    - home.html
    - about_us.html
    - events.html
    - contact_us.html
2. Add any random content into each of the files.
3. Stage, commit and push the changes directly to the main branch. (The is a simulation of the team's existing code base for the website)

**Morgan's Work: Adding Book Reviews**
1. Create a Branch for Morgan:
2. Switch to a new branch named add-book-reviews.
3. Add a new file book_reviews.html to represent the Book Reviews Section:
4. Add a random text content into the file.
5. Stage, commit, and Push Changes with a message like "Add book reviews section."
6. Push the add-book-reviews branch to GitHub.
7. Raise a PR for Morgan's work
8. Merge Morgan's work to the man branch

**Jamie's Work: Updating Events Page**
Repeat the same flow for Jamie's work on Events Page. Ensure Jamie's work is in update-events branch.
 - Pull the latest changes from the main branch into the update-events before raising the PR.
